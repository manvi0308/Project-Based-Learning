### What is this project all about?  <br>
*Its a traditional rock paper scissors game, made using simple random module with a speech functionality added using pyttsx3 module.* <br>
*It will work the following way*
> 1) There are two users, first one is you and second one is computer/your machine.<br>
> 2) You will be asked to enter number of chances or how many times you want to play<br>
> 3) You will enter your moves using input() function, and computer's input will be auto generated using random() module of python<br>
> 4) Depending on the rules(PS : I hope you are familiar with the rules of rock paper scissors game), a winner will be declared<br>
> 5) Also in all the above procedures, sort of live commentory or voice based commentory using pyttsx3 module of python<br>


### How to run this program ?

> 1) Ensure that you have python installed in your system, also use *pip install pyttsx3* in cmd if pyttsx3 module(used for speech functionality) is not installed in your system.<br>
> 2) Clone the file  <br>
> 3) Navigate to the directory where you have saved the code, using cd command<br>
> 4) use command python RPS.py to run the program from command line
<br>

### Future Scope
<br>

1)**Using module Speech Recognition** Will add speech recognition functionality so that user dont have to manually enter like R, P or S, instead it can speak like , I want Rock or something like that and game will be played<br>

2)**Using computer vision** A camera window should be opened and user have to show/make his/her hand gestures to demonstrate its move.<br>

3)**Using Tkinter for GUI** An interactive GUI for the same, with music, live dashboard.
