<h4 align = "left"> What is Web Scraping?</h4>
Data displayed by most websites can only be viewed using a web browser. They do not offer the functionality to save a copy of this data for personal use. The only option then is
to manually copy and paste the data - a very tedious job which can take many hours or sometimes days to complete. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process, 
so that instead of manually copying the data from websites, the Web Scraping software will perform the same task within a fraction of the time.

**Project 1** <br>
Make a corona virus data scraper, that scrapes the number of active cases and stores them in an excel file.
<br>
>Approach
>>1) Request for a response from the webpage.
>>2) Parse and extract with the help of the BeautifulsSoup() class method and lxml module.
>>3) Download and export the data with pandas into Excel.'
<br>

>How to Run this on your system locally?
>> Clone the Repo
>> 1) Use command cd (location where you clone the repo/code) for example *cd Desktop*
>> 2) Assuming that you have python installed with packages (bs4, requests, pandas) use command *Python Name_of_file.py*
>> 3) Also if these are not installed you can directly install using *pip* command from CLI
>> 4) Now after running you will notice that an excel sheet will be created in the directory where you stored the project that contains the data.
