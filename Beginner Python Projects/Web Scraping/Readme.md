<h4 align = "left"> What is Web Scraping?</h4>
Data displayed by most websites can only be viewed using a web browser. They do not offer the functionality to save a copy of this data for personal use. The only option then is
to manually copy and paste the data - a very tedious job which can take many hours or sometimes days to complete. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process, 
so that instead of manually copying the data from websites, the Web Scraping software will perform the same task within a fraction of the time.
